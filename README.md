#The purpose of this application is to convert standard files that would not other wise
#be transferable to a standard text file in a binary format.
# I first recommend going opening the Binary-Beam folder (where you found the README) and creating a desktop shortcut for "BinaryBeam.exe"
##WARNING: If the exe is removed from the folder it will not work
# I also recommend making shortcuts to Binary-Beam\resources\app\WorkingFolder and Binary-Beam\resources\app\Exported on your desktop or like area for ease of access
